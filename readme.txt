= Key Features =

* Lightning-fast search powered by multiple search providers

= Why Merchant Buddy? =

As WooCommerce stores grow, searching through orders, products, and customers becomes increasingly slow and cumbersome. While WooCommerce's HPOS and full-text search have improved order searching, there's still a need for a comprehensive solution that covers all aspects of your store.

= Extensible Architecture =

Merchant Buddy is built with extensibility in mind. Developers can:
* Create custom search providers
* Add support for additional entities
* Customize the search experience

= Premium Features =

The plugin is free to use with your own search provider API keys (bring-your-own-key model).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/merchant-buddy` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Configure your preferred search provider in the plugin settings
4. Start searching from any admin page!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which search provider should I use? =

Algolia is recommended for the best performance, but you can also use the native WooCommerce search if you prefer not to use external services.

= Do I need to pay for the plugin? =

The plugin itself is free. However, if you choose to use Algolia or other external search providers, you'll need to sign up for their services and use your own API keys.

= Can I extend the plugin with custom entities? =

Yes! The plugin is built to be extensible. Developers can add support for custom entities and create their own search providers.
