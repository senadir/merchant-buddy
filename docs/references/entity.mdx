Entities are the core of the search, they are the ones that will be searched against, and they are the ones that will be displayed in the search results. You can read more about entities in the [Concepts -> Entities](./concepts/entities.md) page.

## `AbstractEntity`

```php
use Nadir\MerchantBuddy\Entities\AbstractEntity;
```

All entities should extend the `AbstractEntity` class, which initself implments `EntityInterface`.

`AbstactEntity` injects the currently selected provider into the entity, which can be accessed via `$this->provider`.

<ParamField path="protected: provider" type="ProviderInterface">
  The search provider currently selected in the search settings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="searchable_fields" type="string[]" default="[]">
  An array of fields that should be searchable, this is used by the provider to
  index said fields.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="display_fields" type="string[]" default="[]">
  An array of fields that should be displayed, this is used by the provider to
  return only the needed fields.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="get_searchable_fields(): array" type="string[]">
  Returns an array of fields that should be searchable, this is used by the
  provider to index said fields. This method can be overridden to return a
  different array of fields via filters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="get_display_fields(): array" type="string[]">
  Returns an array of fields that should be displayed, this is used by the
  provider to return only the needed fields. This method can be overridden to
  return a different array of fields via filters.
</ParamField>

## `EntityInterface`

```php
use Nadir\MerchantBuddy\Entities\EntityInterface;
```

Entities are required to implement EntityInterface, which is done via using AbstactEntity.

<ParamField path="get_entity_slug(): string" type="string">

  whatever slug WordPress will use, like a custom post type or taxonomy or user
  role.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="get_entity_label(): string" type="string">
  Returns a plural, human readable, transatable name for the entity.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="init_hooks(): void" type="void">
  Should be where hooks to create, update, and delete items for this entity are
  registred. This is called for enabled entities.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="search( query: string): array" type="Item[]">
  This is relevant if you're using the default provider, this method will search
  the entity based on a search query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="get_item_data( object $item ): array" type="array">
  Should take an entity object (WC_Order, WC_Customer, WC_Product...) and
  returns an array of which data to persist, and what data to display in the
  search results, returns an object of properties and values, the same keys are
  used in layout, searchable_fields and display_fields.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="layout(): array" type="array">

  and what actions to use. The array has the following shape:

    "bindings" => [
      "template_key" => "binding_key"
    ],
    "actions" => [
      "primary_action" => [
        "label" => "string",
        "url" => "binding_key"
      ],
      "secondary_action" => [
        "label" => "string",
        "url" => "binding_key"
      ]

## `Batchable`

```php
use Nadir\MerchantBuddy\Entities\Contracts\Batchable;
```

Entities that support batch queries should implement a `Batchable` contract, which require a single method:

<ParamField
  path="get_items( int $page = 1, int $per_page = 10 ): array"
  type="array"
>
  Takes current pagination and returns an array of length `$per_page` and items
  of `get_item_data` array shape.
</ParamField>
