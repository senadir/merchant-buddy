The `batch` command is used to batch update entities to a provider. It is a powerful tool that allows you to update multiple entities at once.

## Usage

```bash
wp wc batch update orders
```

Will update all orders to the selected provider.

```bash
wp wc batch update orders --provider=algolia
```

Will update all orders to the Algolia provider.

```bash
wp wc batch update all
```

Will update all entities to the selected provider.

```bash
wp wc batch update orders --per-page=50
```

Will update 50 orders at a time instead of 20.

```bash
wp wc batch delete orders
```

Will delete all orders from the selected provider.

Delete supports the same options as the update command.
